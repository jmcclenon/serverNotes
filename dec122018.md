So...
I have a GITHUB repo called travel-site. This collection of files comes from a Udemy course I'm taking. As the course progresses, more of the travel-site will be built out. The point of the course is to show how to use GIT and GITHUB in the process of developing the travel-site web app.

I have the following set up:

**AWS Ubuntu 16.04 server using latest GIT**

 - Local GIT repository synced with GITHUB (travel-site:local -->travel-site:GITHUB) 
 - travel-site app is located in /var/www/html, allowing internet access

**Local VirtualBox VM Ubuntu 18.04 server using latest GIT**

 - Local GIT repository synced with GITHUB (travel-site:local -->travel-site:GITHUB)
 - travel-site app is located in /var/www/html, allowing intra-net access only!
 - travel-site app cannot be accessed from the internet

Working Copy App - iPad 2 GITHUB Client
Local GIT repository synced with GITHUB(travel-sites:iPad -->travel-site:GITHUB)
travel-site is located in the memory space of the Working Copy App
Working Copy can share files with other text editors on the iPad, 

**GITHUB Repository**

 - travel-site
---
	
 I am able to update the app's source files on my local VirtualBox VM, then commit/push these changes to GITHUB. After a PULL on the AWS Ubuntu VM, the newly edited files will be available on the internet.

Changes made on either the local VM or the AWS VM will appear instantly at GITHUB, replacing the previous version.
